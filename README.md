# ripples
This respository is based on a system prompt created by Watson Hartsoe emodying an aesthetic design idea of Terhi Marttila. There are two scenes in this version: one is a reading room in a library and the other is a forest. In either case the viewer can focus on one character and hear their thoughts. The viewer can also whisper to the character and subtly affect those thoughts. The effect ripples to other characters in the scene as well.
    To makek this work, you need to add put in your own OpenAI key.
